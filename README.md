# aoc-rust
A repo to track my advent of code attempts (specifically the ones in Rust)

### How to run:

A simple `cargo run` from the root of the repo should do it. Or you can do a `cargo build` and run the binary from `targets/debug/aoc-rust` (or `targets/release/aoc-rust` if you specified `--release` in your build command)
